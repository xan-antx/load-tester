# Criteria for Project Selection

This document defines the criteria we will use to
choose projects for our software engineering course.
It emphasizes time-to-value through rapid iterations,
supported by CI/CD to enable frequent build, test, and
delivery.  Selection also considers contextual
relevance, available engineering engines, scalability,
and measurable evaluation criteria to ensure we build
solutions that can be validated quickly and
effectively.

## Time-to-value

We **shall** design for rapid delivery, *i.e.* deliver
meaningful increments within a short time window (say
weekly).  And, **prioritize fast feedback over
perfection,** in order to reduce waiting time between
decisions and results.

Initially, you may think of it as:

+ Ship a usable increment within 2 weeks.
+ Complete discovery + prototype + validation in one
  2-week sprint.
+ Success is defined by what can be delivered in the
  first 2-week iteration.
  
### CI/ CD

You might have guessed that the core requirement of
this project is to showcase multiple iterations of
**build, test, and ship,** fast enough for user/ client
to get quick feedback about the product.

> To support our short weekly iteration cadence, we
> should automate build/test/release as much as
> practical.  CI/CD is a good way to achieve
> that—starting with the lightest pipeline we can
> (e.g., CI first) and expanding only if it improves
> delivery.

## Heuristics

### 1. Relevance

> Contextual relevance: The problem affects our
> immediate stakeholders and is within our current
> scope to influence.

A rough equivalent of need statement.  We shall prefer
that your problem be of,

+ Local relevance, *i.e,* relevance to your local
  environment/region/team.
+ Immediate applicability, *i.e,* we can act on it now.
+ (to some extent) Near-term impact, *i.e,* its
  outcomes are soon visible.

### 2. Engine availability

This is an engineering course and not a research
course.  Hence, a necessary heuristic for selection,
should be that one or more mature engine(s) should be
available as an engine for the core solution of the
problem.

We shall address the issues of scalability and
complexity here, rather than fundamental algorithms
itself.  Intuitively, we’ll focus on administrative
aspects of software development, more than operational
or creative aspects.

**PS:** Research delays **shall not** be entertained.

### 3. Scalability

With foresight, your project should be scalable in the
following contexts:

1. **Scalable**: Theoretically speaking, your
   proposition should in principle scale to a larger
   audience than intended.
2. **Operationally Deployable**: Practically speaking,
   your proposition should be deployable using the
   available solutions for an extremely large audience.
   
### 4. Evaluation Criterion

> **Evaluation criterion**: How will we know it worked?

A good proposition/solution usually includes a way to
judge whether the solution actually works.

**The evaluation criterion should be measurable (and
ideally attributable).**

Examples

+ Problem: “Students can’t find answers fast.”  
  Solution: “Add an FAQ search.”  
  Evaluation criterion: “Search results find the
  correct answer within 10 seconds, and users report
  satisfaction ≥ 4/5.”

+ Problem: “The app is slow.”  
  Solution: “Optimize queries.”  
  Evaluation criterion: “Page load time decreases from
  3s to under 1.5s in production.”
  
### 5. Higher-order goal

Treat this as a secondary heuristic, i.e. something to
be fulfilled with a lower priority.

It can be very useful—but mostly as a framing layer,
not as the whole engineering plan.  A higher-order
goal, /e.g./ address climate change, helps 

1. Guides priorities,
2. Creates measurable outcomes,
3. Makes the problem-solution link easier to justify.

But we still need to translate that why (climate
change) into a measurable problem, e.g.

+ Reduce e-waste and “time-to-replace”
+ Reduce network energy and hardware load
+ Lower lifecycle impact by improving reliability (or
  durability)
+ Sustainable operations
+ Digital efficiency

## Conclusion

In selecting a project, we prioritize measurable
time-to-value through rapid, incremental delivery and
fast feedback. CI/CD is the practical mechanism that
makes shipping dependable. We focus on problems with
contextual relevance, available engineering engines,
and scalable, deployable solutions—validated through
clear evaluation criteria—while keeping higher-order
goals as supportive framing rather than primary
drivers.
